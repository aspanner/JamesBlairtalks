* Introduction

This document captures the environment setup steps for a ~30 minute live demo of the [[https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management][Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management]] observability feature for [[https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift][Openshift]].


* Pre-requisites

 This guide assumes you have access to an Amazon Web Services account with persmissions to be able to create resources including ~s3~ buckets and ~ec2~ instances.

 In my case I have an AWS Blank Open Environment provisioned through the Red Hat [[https://demo.redhat.com][demo system]].


* 1 - Logging into aws locally

Our first step is to login to our aws account locally via the ~aws~ cli which will prompt for four values:

#+begin_src tmux
aws configure
#+end_src

#+begin_src text
AWS Access Key ID [****************RAVM]:
AWS Secret Access Key [****************oHWv]:
Default region name [ap-southeast-1]:
Default output format [json]:
#+end_src


* 2 - Creating s3 bucket

After logging into aws lets confirm our permissions are working by creating the ~s3~ bucket we will need later on.

#+begin_src tmux
aws s3 mb "s3://open-cluster-management-observability" --region "$(aws configure get region)"
#+end_src

#+begin_src text
make_bucket: open-cluster-management-observability
#+end_src
