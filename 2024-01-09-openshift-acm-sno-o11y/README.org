* Introduction

This document captures the environment setup steps for a ~30 minute live demo of the [[https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management][Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management]] observability feature for [[https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift][Openshift]].


* Pre-requisites

This guide assumes you:

- Have access to an Amazon Web Services account with permissions to be able to create resources including ~s3~ buckets and ~ec2~ instances. In my case I have an AWS Blank Open Environment provisioned through the Red Hat [[https://demo.redhat.com][demo system]].

- Already have the ~aws~ and ~oc~ cli utilities installed.

- Have registered for a Red Hat account (required for obtaining an OpenShift install image pull secret).


* 1 - Logging into aws locally

Our first step is to login to our aws account locally via the ~aws~ cli which will prompt for four values:

#+begin_src tmux
aws configure
#+end_src


* 2 - Creating s3 bucket

After logging into aws lets confirm our permissions are working by creating the ~s3~ bucket we will need later on.

#+begin_src tmux
aws s3 mb "s3://open-cluster-management-observability" --region "$(aws configure get region)"
#+end_src


* 3 - Install openshift clusters

With our aws credentials working let's move on to deploying the hub and single node openshift cluster required for the live demo.


** 3.1 Download installer tools

Our first step will be to ensure we have the ~openshift-install~ cli tool. We can download it as follows:

#+begin_src tmux
# Download the installer
wget "https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/$(uname -m)/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz"

# Extract the archive
tar xf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
#+end_src


** 3.2 Obtain install pull secret

Next we have a manual step to login to the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console and obtain our **Pull Secret** which will be required for our installation configuration.

Open the [[https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local][Console]] and click **Download pull secret**. This will download a file called ~pull-secret.txt~ which will be used later on.


** 3.3 Initiate the hub cluster install

Once our install tooling is available let's kick off the installation of our hub cluster by creating a configuration file and then running ~openshift-install~.

#+begin_src tmux
cat << EOF > hub-install-config-yaml
