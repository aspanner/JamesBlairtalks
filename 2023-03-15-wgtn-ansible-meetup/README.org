ChatOps is a collaboration model that connects people, tools, process, and automation into a transparent workflow. This flow connects the work needed, the work happening, and the work done in a persistent location staffed by the people, bots, and related tools.

This is a short 15 minute lightning talk showcasing how we can leverage the [[https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-platform][Ansible Automation Platform]] Automation [[https://www.ansible.com/products/controller][Controller]] as the engine to power ChatOps style end to self service workflows in Atlassian Jira.
